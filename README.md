Exoskeletons are often called wearable robots because of it's close interaction with the human. Being so, the exoskeletons must be responsive to user movement.

In this project, we desire to investigate the human joint and robotic joint interaction in a modular approach in a way that this is usefull for several applications.

## How to contribute
This project is on it's initial stages. If you want to contribute, take a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/biopmr/ModExo/issues) for already identified needs or at the [main code](https://github.com/biopmr/ModExo/blob/master/arduino_control/arduino_control.ino) and identify issues yourself!

## Testing
The hardware is not easy to set up by yourself. An workflow to test remote contributions is still needed. For now, just contact the e-mail below and we'll upload the changes and publish the results.
