	1. Experimental Setup
		a. Exo Loli -> mechanical solution for harmonic drive dettachment problem
		b. Driver EPOS2
			a. Positioning System PID
			b. Analog-Digital Communication
			c. CAN BUS
		c. Modular Approach
			The knowledge of which human limb is actuated is not crucial.
			Which parameters matters(global)?
			Which ones are especific(local)?
	2. Impedance Control
		What is impedance control?
		Why impedance control?

	3. Github
		a. File Management x Knowledge Management (Dropbox x Github)
		b. Git / Versioning / Commits
			experimental\readme.md
			arduino_tests\teste.m
		c. Issues
			Software x Hardware 
				Cable for exoskeleton
		wd. ModExo Viewer / Telemetry Viewer
