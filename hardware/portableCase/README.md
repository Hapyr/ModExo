  The ModExo Portable Case was built by Priscila Veiga ([primiki](https://github.com/primiki)), a Lab's collaborator, and designed by Priscila Veiga and Rafael Sanchez Souza ([rafaelsanchezsouza](https://github.com/rafaelsanchezsouza)). The result can be seen in figures that follows. 

## Requirements
The following requirements were defined for the case design:
- All the mechanical interface and control hardware must fit a portable case
- The robotic joint movement axis will rotate in parallel with the gravity
- The height of the case must be as low as possible 
- An emergency button should shut the whole system down if needed
- There should be communication between the control hardware inside the case and the equipment outside the case
- There should be space for control hardware volume, in the case that another degree of freedom is added 
- The control hardware must be visible with the case closed
- The interior of the case must be of easy access, in the need of maintenance
- There must be an exit for the power supply air expelled by the fan
- The motor must be supported by a rigid structure, that can support the weight of a person's arm
